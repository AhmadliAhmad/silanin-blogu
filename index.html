                <h3>I think so, this is it. </h3>
                <p>Design begins after I begin to think about how to present an experience most successfully, whether a button I put in can solve a problem. The only point in design is not ui design, if the user does not have a good experience at the end of the product, the design will be considered unsuccessful in my opinion.

            <h3 class="post-title">Little distinction between primary and secondary buttons.</h3>
            <p class="post-info">
                When working with apps, you will have many actions that the user is able to complete. It is important to give visual importance to the primary actions. All the navigation happens through buttons, so you have to make it easy for the user to identify the primary buttons by making them bold and prominent. Secondary actions should be less prominent but still visible if the user is looking for them.

            <h3 class="post-title">Pointless inconsistency in your UI elements.</h3>
            <p class="post-info">
                To ensure a smooth and concise app, avoid using too many different styles. This will send mixed signals to your users! The key is repeating patterns and elements any time you can. A consistent-looking design goes a long way in establishing trust with your visitors and in creating an enjoyable experience. Plus, it will help your users learn their way around  your app much faster.

            <h3 class="post-title">Bad iconography.</h3>
            <p class="post-info">
                Sometimes icons seem to be the “easiest” part of the design. Some designers even see them as an “extra” decorative element, when in fact they are also a fundamental part of modern interfaces. Especially on mobile where icons are the equivalent of buttons (just take a look at Snapchat) you will find an interface that is mostly made of icons.

That’s why it is so important to choose the right “symbol” that clearly communicates the element’s meaning, and to keep a consistent style for the icons throughout your app.

            <h3 class="post-title"> Low contrast.</h3>
            <p class="post-info">
                Contrast is everything on a visual composition. When you have low contrast between your interface elements, all of the elements merge together and you end up with a dull and  hard-to-read interface because it all looks the same. Low contrast is equal to low usability.
